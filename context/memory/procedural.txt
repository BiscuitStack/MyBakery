# Procedural Memory

Validated Workflows
- Cognitive loop: perceive → plan → act → verify → reflect → document.
- Use `nx affected -t lint,test,build` for PR validation.

Runbooks
- Initialize docs/memory: create `context/memory/*`, `codex/TODO.md`, `docs/architecture.md`.
- Prisma maintenance: `pnpm install`, `pnpm prisma:generate`, and `pnpm prisma:db:push` against the service-specific database once schema definitions exist.

Verified Commands
- `nx graph`, `nx run-many -t lint|test|build` (Nx v18 range).

Patterns
- Small, deterministic changes; one step in progress at a time.
