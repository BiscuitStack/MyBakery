# Semantic Memory

Domain Concepts
- Monorepo managed by Nx; apps in `apps/`, libs in `libs/`.
- Services communicate over RabbitMQ; API Gateway (NestJS) + Frontend (Next.js).

Architectural Rationale
- Enforce boundaries with Nx tags and `@bakewise/*` path aliases.
- Unified error shape: { status, code, message, details? }.
- Soft-delete policy across entities; UUID v4 IDs.

Constraints & Standards
- Language: TypeScript; 2-space indent; ~100 char lines.
- Tests: ≥90% coverage for core libs and services.

Persistence
- PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM; each microservice maintains its own schema. Shared helpers in `libs/database`; models defined during service implementation.
